Objective
To build an application that detects the user's mood from images or videos and provides personalized music recommendations based on their detected emotional state.

Methodology
Set up directories: Define paths for the training and testing data directories containing mood-labeled images or video frames.

Preprocess data:

Use ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation, rescaling, and splitting the training data (80% for training, 20% for validation).
Generate training and validation datasets with 128x128 resolution and batch size of 32.
Initialize base model: Load a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model without the top layer, configured for 128x128 input images, to leverage transfer learning.

Fine-tune model:

Freeze all layers except the last 10 layers of MobileNetV2 for more effective mood classification.
Add custom dense layers: a global average pooling layer, a dense layer with 256 units and ReLU activation, dropout for regularization, and a final softmax output layer for 7 mood classes.
Compile model: Use Adam optimizer with a low learning rate (0.0001), categorical cross-entropy loss, and accuracy as the metric.

Set up early stopping: Use early stopping with patience of 3 epochs to avoid overfitting, restoring the best weights when validation loss ceases to improve.

Train model: Train the model on the training dataset with validation data for 10 epochs.

Save model: Save the trained model to disk as 'fast_mood_classifier_model.h5'.

Visualize training progress:

Plot training and validation accuracy over epochs.
Plot training and validation loss over epochs to evaluate the learning curve.
Load model and test data:

Load the saved model.
Use a test data generator to preprocess test images.
Evaluate model: Evaluate test accuracy and loss to assess the model's performance on unseen data.

Predict moods: Use the model to predict mood labels on test images and compare these predictions with true labels.

Load music data: Load a music dataset containing song details and mood labels.

Recommend music based on mood:

Filter songs that match the detected mood.
Randomly recommend a song and display its details.
